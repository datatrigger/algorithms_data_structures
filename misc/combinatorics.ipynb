    "There are $2^n$ subsets in a set of size $n$.  \n",
    "Justification: each of the $n$ elements is included or not in a given subset (2 possibilities).\n",

    "E.g. **anagrams**. Here it is important to note that the object at hand is a **multiset** and not a set. In this case, start from the definition of a permutation without repetition (case $k = n$ i.e. $P(n, n)$), and account for the permutations of identical elements within this k-permutation:\n",

    "Example: the word \"mississipi\" has $\\frac{11!}{1! \\, 2! \\, 4! \\, 4!}$ anagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial interpretation: the multinomial coefficient can also be seen as the number of ways to put $k_1$ objects in bin $1$, $k_2$ objects in bin $2$, ..., $k_m$ objects in bin $m$ with $k_1 + ... + k_m = n$ distinct objects. To connect this interpretation with the anagram one, consider the indices of the word as the n distinct objects. Grant $k_1$ of these spots to the letters repeated $k_1$ times, and so on.\n",
