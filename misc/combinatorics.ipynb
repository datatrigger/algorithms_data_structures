    "$$P(n, k) = n \\cdot (n - 1) \\cdot (n - 2) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (n - k + 1) = \\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$$\n",

    "### Permutations of a set with repetitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called **words** over the alphabet S. If S is a set of n (distinct, by definition of a set) elements, then there are $n^k$ permutations of size k with repetitions.\n",

    "### Permutations of a multiset, case k = n\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. **anagrams**. Here it is important to note that the object at hand is a **multiset** and not a set. Hence with/without repetitions concepts do not apply here since there is a fixed amount of repetitions by definition of a multiset. In this case, start from the definition of a permutation without repetition (case $k = n$ i.e. $P(n, n)$), and account for the permutations of identical elements within this k-permutation:\n",

    "This happens to be a multinomial coefficient.\n",

    "Example: the word \"mississipi\" has $\\frac{11!}{1! \\, 2! \\, 4! \\, 4!}$ anagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial interpretation: the multinomial coefficient can also be seen as the number of ways to put $k_1$ objects in bin $1$, $k_2$ objects in bin $2$, ..., $k_m$ objects in bin $m$ with $k_1 + ... + k_m = n$ distinct objects. To connect this interpretation with the anagram one, consider the indices of the word as the n distinct objects. Grant $k_1$ of these spots to the letters repeated $k_1$ times, and so on.\n",

    "A k-combination of a set $S$ is a subset of $k$ distinct elements of $S$. There are $\\binom{n}{k} = [n \\cdot (n - 1) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (n - k + 1)] \\cdot \\frac{1}{k!}= \\frac{n!}{k! \\cdot (n-k)!}$ k-combinations: choose $k$ elements, then account for the permutations of the $k$ elements.\n",
