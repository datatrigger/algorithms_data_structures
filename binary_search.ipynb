    "# Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search algorithms operate on *sorted* arrays. By *sorted* we mean that there is a condition ` condition(x: T) -> bool` such that all the elements that verify the condition are on one side of the array, and all the other elements are on the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to implement binary search, so the best way to avoid out-of-bound indices or infinite loops is to stick to the same template.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def binary_search(sorted_array: list[T]) -> int:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Returns the min index `i` for which `condition(i)` holds.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def condition(i: int) -> bool:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    l, r = min_inclusive_index_bound, max_inclusive_index_bound\n",
    "    while l < r:\n",
    "        m = (l + r) // 2\n",
    "        if condition(m):\n",
    "            r = m\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            l = m + 1\n",
    "    return l\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust the template by:\n",
    "* Defining the appropriate inclusice bounds for the index\n",
    "* Defining the right `condition()` function\n",
    "* Returing either `l` (minimal index with `condition` holding) or `l - 1` (maximal index not verifying `condition`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why it works\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finite loop: the loop necessarily ends because the quantity `l - r` decreases by at least 1 at each step:\n",
    "    * int division `//` rounds down in Python, and `l < r`, so `m < r`: the assignment `r = m` decreases `r` by at least 1\n",
    "    * `l` can be `m` but the statement `l = m + 1` ensures `l` increases by at least 1\n",
    "* Go left or right:\n",
    "    * When the condition is false at index `m`, we know for sure m is not the minimal index for which the condition holds: we can safely increment `l` to the right of `m`\n",
    "    * When the condition is true at index `m`, m could be the minimal index for which the condition holds: reassign `r` to `m`\n",
    "* Return value. `l` and `r` are guaranteed to be equal at the end of the loop, so we can return either one of them."
