    "## 1 Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $2^n$ subsets in a set of size $n$.  \n",
    "Justification: each of the $n$ elements is included or not in a given subset (2 possibilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $S$ be a set of $n$ elements and $k \\leq n$. The number of ways to partition $S$ into $k$ non-empty subsets is the Stirling number of the second kind, denoted $\\begin{Bmatrix} n\\\\ k \\end{Bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of ways to partition S is the Bell number:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ B_n = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n} \\begin{Bmatrix} n\\\\ k \\end{Bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If order is considered, then multiply each Stirling number of the second kind by $k!$ to account for all possible permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful recurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ B_{n + 1} = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} B_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof/Intuition: to build a partition of $n + 1$ elements, first make the subset containing the $(n+1)_{th}$ element. One can choose any $k, 0 \\leq k \\leq n$, then choose k elements in $\\binom{n}{k}$ ways. The rest of the $n - k$ elements can then be partitioned in $B_{n - k}$ ways. The recurrence follows by summing on all possible $k$ and invoking the symmetry of binomial coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above relation helps proving the Bell numbers are roughly exponential in $n$, by observing $B_{n + 1} \\geq B_n + n B_{n - 1}$. The [actual time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_number#Growth_rate) of Bell numbers is... Complex.\n",

    "Permutations take **order** into account.\n",

    "### 3.1 Permutations of a set i.e. without repetitions\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(n, k) = n \\cdot (n - 1) \\cdot (n - 2) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (n - k + 1) = \\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Special case: $k = n$. There are $n!$ possible permutations of n distinct elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Permutations of a multiset i.e. with repetitions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.1 Infinite multiplicities\n",
    "\n",
    "Or equivalently, finite multiplicities but all multiplicities $> k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called **words** over the alphabet S. If S is a set of n (distinct, by definition of a set) elements, then there are $n^k$ permutations of size k with repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.2 Finite multiplicities\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.2.2.1 Case k = n\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. **anagrams**. Here it is important to note that the object at hand is a **multiset** and not a set. In this case, start from the definition of a permutation without repetition (case $k = n$ i.e. $P(n, n)$), and account for the permutations of identical elements within this k-permutation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, ..., k_m} = \\frac{n!}{k_1! \\cdot k_2! \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot k_m!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens to be a multinomial coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: the word \"mississipi\" has $\\frac{11!}{1! \\, 2! \\, 4! \\, 4!}$ anagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial interpretation: the multinomial coefficient can also be seen as the number of ways to put $k_1$ objects in bin $1$, $k_2$ objects in bin $2$, ..., $k_m$ objects in bin $m$ with $k_1 + ... + k_m = n$ distinct objects. To connect this interpretation with the anagram one, consider the indices of the word as the n distinct objects. Grant $k_1$ of these spots to the letters repeated $k_1$ times, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also: [Multinomial theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem), which can be interpreted from the combinatorial perspective (bins).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.2.2.2 Any k\n",
    "\n",
    "No fixed formula in this case, generating functions are needed. See *An invitation to combinatorics*, Shahriar Shahriari.\n",

    "Combinations are subsets, so order is not taken into account.\n",

    "### 4.1 Combinations of a set i.e. without repetitions\n",
    "\n",
    "A k-combination of a set $S$ is a subset of $k$ distinct elements of $S$. There are $\\binom{n}{k} = [n \\cdot (n - 1) \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (n - k + 1)] \\cdot \\frac{1}{k!}= \\frac{n!}{k! \\cdot (n-k)!}$ k-combinations: choose $k$ elements, then account for the permutations of the $k$ elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinations are another way to compute the total number of subsets:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n $$\n",

    "#### 4.2.1 Infinite multiplicities\n",
    "\n",
    "Or equivalently, finite multiplicities but all multiplicities $> k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} n\\\\ k \\end{pmatrix} \\end{pmatrix} = \\binom{n + k - 1}{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: stars and bars. $n$ multichoose $k$ can be seen as choosing $k$ elements, i.e **stars** \\*, from $n$ *kinds* or *groups* available, i.e **bars** |. For instance, the subset $\\{ 1, 3, 3 \\}$ from set $\\{ 1, 3, 3 \\}$ would be represented by: *||**. There are $k$ stars and $n - 1$ bars to arrange together, i.e $k$ stars to lay out in $n + k - 1$ available spots, or identically, $n - 1$ bars to lay out in $n + k - 1$ available sports. The number of ways to do exactly that is $\\binom{n + k - 1}{k}$.\n",

    "#### 4.2.2 Finite multiplicities\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.2.2.1 Case k = n\n",
    "\n",
    "Trivial: there is only 1 way to choose all the elements, regardless of their order.\n",

    "## Subarrays\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note 1: subarray = substring, in the context of strings*\n",
    "\n",
    "A subarray is a contiguous subsequence. A subarray is completely determined by its start and end indices, hence there are $\\frac{n \\cdot (n + 1)}{2}$ subarrays in an array of length $n$. Two ways to see this:\n",
    "* For every start index $0 \\leq i < n$, there are $n-i$ possible end indices, so $n + (n - 1) + ... + 1$ subarrays\n",
    "* A subarray is determined by a set of 2 distinct indices $0 \\leq i, j \\leq n$. Notice that the end index *can* be n. There are $\\binom{n + 1}{2}$ ways to form a subarray\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note 2: in array `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, `a[0:2]` and `a[2:4]` are considered to be the exact same subarray.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subsequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequences maintain order but bot contiguity. There can be duplicates in a subsequence! `[1, 1, 2]` is a subsequence of `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`. There are $2^n$ subsequences for an array of size $n$ because every element is included or not when building a subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "No contiguity neither order, but no duplicates allowed. If the array at hand does not contain duplicates, then there are as many subsets as subsequences (since the order does not matter with sets, any given set can be \"ordered\" to be written exactly as 1 corresponding subsequence, and reciprocally every subsequence is a subset).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $2^{n'}$ subsets where $n'$ is the number of unique elements in the array."
